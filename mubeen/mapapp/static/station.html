                Ramanathapuram Railway Station (station code: RMD) is a major railhead in Tamil Nadu's Ramanathapuram district. 
                It is well-connected to key cities like Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, and Trichy via several express and passenger trains. 
                The station serves as the main rail gateway for pilgrims visiting the famous Ramanathaswamy Temple in town and for travellers heading to the pilgrimage island of Rameswaram (connected via a separate branch line from Mandapam). 
                Facilities include basic waiting areas, reservation counters, and food stalls, with auto-rickshaws and taxis available outside for local transport.
